  <h3>Marni is an aspiring software developer, living in Perth Amboy, NJ.</h3>
  
  <h3>Marni's journey to software development</h3>
  <p>Marni has worked in the technical field since she was 20 years old when she worked as Technology Associate at Staples, fixing various computer issues for customers and using her technical expertise to help them choose the correct items to meet their personal needs. </p>
  <p>In 2014, Marni received her Associates Degree, with a major in Network Engineering Technologies. Then, she earned 3 technical certifications: CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network +, and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA). These accomplishments propeled her career in Technology. Since then, she has held several roles in the technical field.</p>
  <p>For the past 4 years, Marni has worked as a Technical Support Specialist for her local county government, supporting 2000 users. Through this dynamic role, she gained exposure in various sectors of the IT field, providing remote and on-site resolutions for hardware and software issues across all of the county departments.</p>
  <p>Marni established excellent troubleshooting skills, but discovered that she preferred to troubleshoot software issues at her desk, as opposed to being on her feet fixing hardware issues. This led her to discover her passion for coding.</p>
  <p>In August of 2020, Marni began her journey at Epicodus Bootcamp. Her amazing experience validated that software development was her true calling.</p>
  <p>In Marni's spare time, she enjoys:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walking her Saint Bernard, Nemo</li>
    <li>Catching up with friends and family</li>
    <li>Traveling and exploring new places</li>
  </ul>
