      <h4><u>How my Coding Journey Began</u></h4>
      <p>I have worked in the technical field since I was 20 years old when I was a Technology Associate at Staples, fixing various computer issues for customers and using my technical expertise to help them choose the correct items to meet their personal needs. </p>
      <p>In 2014, I received my Associates Degree, with a major in Network Engineering Technologies. Subsequently, I earned 3 technical certifications: 
        <ol>
          <li>CompTIA A+</li>
          <li>CompTIA Network+</li>
          <li>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</li>
        </ol>
      These accomplishments propeled my career in Technology. Since then, I have held several roles in the technical field.</p>
      <p>For the past 4 years, I have worked as a Technical Support Specialist for my local county government, supporting 2000 users. Through this dynamic role, I gained exposure in various sectors of the IT field, providing remote and on-site resolutions for hardware and software issues across all of the county departments.</p>
      <p>I established excellent troubleshooting skills, but discovered that I preferred to troubleshoot software issues at my desk, rather than being on my feet fixing hardware issues. This led me to discover my passion for coding and my discovery of <strong>Epicodus</strong>, <span>a coding bootcamp to fast track my path to my new career.</span></p>

      <h4><u>Epicodus</u></h4>
      <p>In August of 2020, I began my journey at Epicodus. I had an amazing experience, validating that software development was my true calling.</p>
      <p>Epicodus fostered a supportive, vibrant community of people like me who were excited to start a career in software development. The program was structured where the majority of the time was spent programming in pairs and in development teams, emphasizing the importance of communication and professional documentation. I developed a strong foundation in the following technologies:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>.Net</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Markdown</li>
        </ul>

      <h4><u>Hobbies</u></h4>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walking my Saint Bernard, Nemo</li>
        <li>Catching up with friends and family</li>
        <li>Traveling and exploring new places</li>
